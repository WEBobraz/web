  Webpack is a free and open-source module bundler for JavaScript. It is made
  primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets such as HTML,
  CSS, and images if the corresponding loaders are included. Webpack takes
  modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those
  modules.
