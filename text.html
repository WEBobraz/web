  Webpack is a free and open-source module bundler for JavaScript. It is made
  primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets such as HTML,
  CSS, and images if the corresponding loaders are included. Webpack takes
  modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those
  modules.

// BEM - popular abstract way of thinking about our interface: // Block - is an
independent, reusable part of our design // Element - belongs to a block. It
cannot be used outside of the block that it belongs to. // Modifier - can be
used on a block or an element to indicate a change to the default // state of an
object. // Bad code: // .large-hero h1 // font-weight: 300; // devServer: {
static: { directory: path.join(__dirname, 'app'), }, hot: true, port: 3000,
liveReload: false },
